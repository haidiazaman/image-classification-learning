Full Workflow
1. imports
2. dataset class
3. define transforms for train val test
4. initialise train val test data and dataloader
5. plot images to visualise
6. create model
7. loss and optimizers
8. def get_accuracy function and initialise device and model.to(device)
9. training and validation loops
10. plot results of train and val logs for loss and acc
11. make predictions on test, only need outputs=forward pass and predictions
